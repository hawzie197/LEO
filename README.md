# PROJECT-LEO


The purpose of Leo is to prove to myself that I am able to in fact build a simple AI assistant. In the
future, after multiple code revisions and cleanups, I would like to add a simple swift app to record and send the audio commands.
This would ensure a more accurate recognition of the person talking as well as the recording time be controlled by person.

This summer (2017), I will be working on adding a conversational dialogue engine to Leo in order to allow him to maintain conversation
instead of just completing commands.

After The above code has been completed, the next step for Leo is to add a GeoSpacial Mapping Module. I would like to add various
mapping functions that can help with big data sets.
